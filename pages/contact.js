      para="Please subscribe to my mailing list below and I'll get in touch. I won't send you loads of annoying emails, just information about classes when required and I've made the unsubscribe option really simple if you decide it's not for you! If you're the kind of person who needs to commit to motivate yourself, then you can purchase a 6 week block. Alternatively if you're not feeling confident to do that, just come and give it ago on a pay as you go basis. I'm all about finding what's best for you so normally I'd suggest a quick call first."/>
